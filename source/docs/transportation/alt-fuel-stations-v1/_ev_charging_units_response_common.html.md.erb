The response is a CSV data download that includes information about EV charging power output by connector type matching the requested query. Each row in the spreadsheet represents an EV charging unit that might have one or more ports and one or more connectors. A single station location may have multiple rows in the spreadsheet.

The table below documents the columns unique to this data download. For documentation on the remaining columns in the CSV, see the response fields for the [All Stations endpoint](/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/all/#response-fields).
